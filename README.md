# ðŸ§  Logistic Regression for Binary Classification

A simple yet effective implementation of **Logistic Regression** for binary classification using Python.  
Developed and presented by **Mohima Binte Rasel**, this project demonstrates how logistic regression can be applied to classify binary outcomes with visual insights and model evaluation metrics.

## Workflow

1. **Import Required Libraries**  
   Includes popular Python packages such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `sklearn`.

2. **Load and Explore Dataset**  
   Dataset loaded and inspected to understand structure, missing values, and distribution.

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing or categorical values  
   - Splitting into training and test sets  
   - Feature scaling (if applicable)

4. **Model Implementation**  
   - Applying **Logistic Regression** using `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression`  
   - Fitting the model on training data

5. **Prediction and Evaluation**  
   - Making predictions on test data  
   - Calculating model accuracy  
   - Visualizing results (confusion matrix, classification report)

6. **Conclusion**  
   Final performance summary and interpretation of results.
